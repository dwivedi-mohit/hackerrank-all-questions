Find and print MegaMaid's next move.

## Problem Statement

MegaMaid is a robot whose function is to move through a matrix and clean all of its *dirty* cells. It's positioned in some cell of an $h \times w$ matrix of *dirty* (`d`) and *clean* (`-`) cells. It can perform five types of operations:

- `LEFT`: Move one cell to the left.
- `RIGHT`: Move one cell to the right.
- `UP`: Move one cell up.
- `DOWN`: Move one cell down.
- `CLEAN`: Clean the cell.

Given the robot's current location and the configuration of *dirty* and *clean* cells in the matrix, print the *next* operation MegaMaid will perform (e.g., `UP`, `CLEAN`, etc.) on a new line.

## Input Format

The first line contains two space-separated integers describing the respective $x$ (row) and $y$ (column) coordinates of MegaMaid's initial location.	
The second line contains two space-separated integers describing the respective height, $h$, and width, $w$, of the matrix.		
Each line $i$ of the $h$ subsequent lines contains a string of $w$ characters describing row $i$ in the matrix; each character $j$ describes the character at location $(i, j)$ according to the following key:

- `b` denotes MegaMaid's location (in a clean cell).
- `d` denotes a dirty cell.
- `-` denotes a clean cell.

**Note:** If MegaMaid is initially located in a dirty cell, the cell will be marked with a `d` (not a `b`).

## Output Format

Print the next operation MegaMaid will perform (i.e., `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `UP`, `DOWN`, `CLEAN`). It's important to only print the *next* operation, because your program will be called iteratively after performing each operation.

## Constraints

- $1 \le w \le 50$

- $1 \le h \le 50$
