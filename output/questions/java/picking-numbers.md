## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers, find the longest subarray where the absolute difference between any two elements is less than or equal to $1$.  

**Example**  

$a=[1,1,2,2,4,4,5,5,5]$  

There are two subarrays meeting the criterion: $[1,1,2,2]$ and $[4,4,5,5,5]$.  The maximum length subarray has $5$ elements.

**Function Description**  

Complete the *pickingNumbers* function in the editor below.  

pickingNumbers has the following parameter(s):  

- *int a[n]:* an array of integers  

**Returns**  

- *int:*  the length of the longest subarray that meets the criterion  

## Input Format

The first line contains a single integer $n$, the size of the array $a$.   	
The second line contains $n$ space-separated integers, each an $a[i]$.

## Constraints

- $2 \le n \le 100$
- $0 < a[i] < 100$
- The answer will be $\ge 2$. 

## Sample Input

6
4 6 5 3 3 1

## Sample Output

3

## Explanation

We choose the following multiset of integers from the array: . Each pair in the multiset has an absolute difference  (i.e.,  and ), so we print the number of chosen integers, , as our answer.
