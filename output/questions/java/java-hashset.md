## Preview

Find unique pair of strings using java Hashset.

## Problem Statement

In computer science, a set is an abstract data type that can store certain values, without any particular order, and no repeated values(Wikipedia). $\{1,2,3\}$ is an example of a set, but $\{1,2,2\}$ is not a set. Today you will learn how to use sets in java by solving this problem.<br>

You are given $n$ pairs of strings. Two pairs $(a,b)$ and $(c,d)$ are identical if $a=c$ and $b=d$. That also implies $(a,b)$ is *not* same as $(b,a)$. After taking each pair as input, you need to print number of unique pairs you currently have.

Complete the code in the editor to solve this problem.

## Input Format

In the first line, there will be an integer $T$ denoting number of pairs. Each of the next $T$ lines will contain two strings seperated by a single space.

**Constraints:**

* $1 \le T \le 100000$
* Length of each string is atmost $5$ and will consist lower case letters only.

## Output Format

Print $T$ lines. In the $i_{th}$ line, print number of unique pairs you have after taking $i^{th}$ pair as input.
