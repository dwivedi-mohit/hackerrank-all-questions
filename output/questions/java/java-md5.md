## Problem Statement

*MD5* (*Message-Digest algorithm 5*) is a widely-used cryptographic hash function with a $128$-bit hash value. Here are some common uses for *MD5*:

* To store a one-way hash of a password.
* To provide some assurance that a transferred file has arrived intact. 

*MD5* is one in a series of message digest algorithms designed by Professor Ronald Rivest of MIT (Rivest, $1994$); however, the security of *MD5* has been severely compromised, most infamously by the Flame malware in $2012$. The *CMU Software Engineering Institute* essentially considers *MD5* to be ["cryptographically broken and unsuitable for further use"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5).

Given an alphanumeric string, $s$, denoting a password, compute and print its *MD5* encryption value.


## Input Format

A single alphanumeric string denoting $s$. 

## Output Format

Print the *MD5* encryption value of $s$ on a new line.

## Constraints

* $ 6 \le |s| \le 20 $
- String $s$ consists of English alphabetic letters (i.e., $[a-zA-Z]$ and/or decimal digits (i.e., $0$ through $9$) only.

## Sample Input

HelloWorld
