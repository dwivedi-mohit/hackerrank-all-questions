## Problem Statement

You are required to compute the power of a number by implementing a calculator. Create a class *MyCalculator* which consists of a single method `long power(int, int)`. This method takes two integers, $n$ and $p$, as parameters and finds $n^p$. If either $n$ or $p$ is negative, then the method must throw an exception which says "$\texttt{n or p should not be negative}$". Also, if both $n$ and $p$ are zero, then the method must throw an exception which says "$\texttt{n and p should not be zero.}$"

For example, *-4* and *-5* would result in $\texttt{java.lang.Exception: n or p should not be negative}$.

Complete the function `power` in class *MyCalculator* and return the appropriate result after the power operation or an appropriate exception as detailed above. 

## Input Format

Each line of the input contains two integers, $n$ and $p$. The locked stub code in the editor reads the input and sends the values to the method as parameters.

## Output Format

Each line of the output contains the result $n^p$, if both $n$ and $p$ are positive. If either $n$ or $p$ is negative, the output contains "n and p should be non-negative". If 
both $n$ and $p$ are zero, the output contains "n and p should not be zero.". This is printed by the locked stub code in the editor.

## Constraints

- $-10 \le n \le 10$
- $-10 \le p \le 10$

## Sample Input

3 5
2 4
0 0
-1 -2
-1 3

## Sample Output

243
16
java.lang.Exception: n and p should not be zero.
java.lang.Exception: n or p should not be negative.
java.lang.Exception: n or p should not be negative.

## Explanation

- In the first two cases, both  and  are postive. So, the power function returns the answer correctly.

- In the third case, both  and  are zero. So, the exception, "n and p should not be zero.", is printed.

- In the last two cases, at least one out of  and  is negative. So, the exception, "n or p should not be negative.", is printed for these two cases.
