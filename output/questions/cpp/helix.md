## Problem Statement

Natural numbers from 1 to N have been placed in an increasing order over some helix ( a circular structure ). When the helix starts rotating, it is easy to find out 

1. The position of a given number
2. The number located at a given position. 

The helix has numbers arranged in the following fashion:  

    [1, 2, 3, ..., N]
    
Due to some malfunction, the helix has started rotating in a weird manner. Right now, every possible contiguous interval can be rotated, and hence, locating a particular number or identifying the number at a given position is almost impossible. For example, if at some particular instant, the integer list is like this:

	[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ..., N]
    
rotating the interval [5...N] will leave the list like this:

	[1, 2, 3, 4, N, N - 1, N - 2, ..., 5]
    
We need a software to handle this. Can you help us?

**Input Format**  
The first line of the input consists of two space separated integers, **N, Q**. *N* signifies that initially our list contains numbers from 1 to N, placed in an increasing order. *Q* lines follow and contain input in one of the following formats:  

	1 A B
    
indicating that the helix rotated circularly in the interval [A..B] ( both inclusive);

	2 A
    
indicating that we are interested in knowing the current position of the number A  

	3 A
   
indicating that we are interested in knowing the number at position A.  

**Output Format**  
For each line in the input of the form `2 A`  

output a line saying 

    element A is at position x
    
where *A* is the number we are interested in and *x* is its current position.

For each line of the form `3 A`

output a line saying 

    element at position A is x
    
where *A* is the position we are interested in and *x* is the integer located at this position. 

**Constraints**  

1 &le; *N, Q* &le; 10<sup>5</sup>  
positions are 1-indexed.   

**Sample Input**

    5 10
    1 1 3
    2 3
    3 3
    1 3 5
    1 2 4
    3 1
    3 5
    2 4
    1 5 5
    2 2
    
**Sample Output**

    element 3 is at position 1
    element at position 3 is 1
    element at position 1 is 3
    element at position 5 is 1
    element 4 is at position 2
    element 2 is at position 4

**Explanation**

Initially elements are placed like this:

	[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
after the first rotation, they are placed like this:

	[3, 2, 1, 4, 5]
    
and that's how we get the first 2 results (first 2 lines in the output). After second rotation, they are placed like this:

	[3, 2, 5, 4, 1]
    
and third one does this:

	[3, 4, 5, 2, 1]
    
In the last rotation (1 5 5), it's easy to see that output matches the initial positions of the elements. Last rotation doesn't change the positions of the elements.

## Input Format

The first line of the input consists of two space separated integers, N, Q. N signifies that initially our list contains numbers from 1 to N, placed in an increasing order. Q lines follow and contain input in one of the following formats:

1 A B

indicating that the helix rotated circularly in the interval [A..B] ( both inclusive);

2 A

indicating that we are interested in knowing the current position of the number A

3 A

indicating that we are interested in knowing the number at position A.

## Output Format

For each line in the input of the form 2 A

output a line saying

element A is at position x

where A is the number we are interested in and x is its current position.

For each line of the form 3 A

output a line saying

element at position A is x

where A is the position we are interested in and x is the integer located at this position.

## Constraints

1 ≤ N, Q ≤ 105

positions are 1-indexed.

2 3
3 3

## Sample Output

element 3 is at position 1
element at position 3 is 1
element at position 1 is 3
element at position 5 is 1
element 4 is at position 2
element 2 is at position 4
