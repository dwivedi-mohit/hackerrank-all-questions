## Problem Statement

Consider a matrix where each cell contains either a $0$ or a $1$.  Any cell containing a $1$ is called a *filled* cell. Two cells are said to be *connected* if they are adjacent to each other horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.  In the following grid, all cells marked `X` are connected to the cell marked `Y`.

    XXX
    XYX  
    XXX    

If one or more filled cells are also connected, they form a *region*. Note that each cell in a region is connected to zero or more cells in the region but is not necessarily directly connected to all the other cells in the region.

Given an $n \times m$ matrix, find and print the number of cells in the largest *region* in the matrix. Note that there may be more than one region in the matrix.

For example, there are two regions in the following $3 \times 3$ matrix.  The larger region at the top left contains $3$ cells.  The smaller one at the bottom right contains $1$.

**Function Description**  

Complete the *connectedCell* function in the editor below.  

connectedCell has the following parameter(s):  
- *int matrix[n][m]*: $matrix[i]$ represents the $i^{th}$ row of the matrix  

**Returns**   
- *int:* the area of the largest region  

## Input Format

The first line contains an integer $n$, the number of rows in the matrix.		
The second line contains an integer $m$, the number of columns in the matrix.		
Each of the next $n$ lines contains $m$ space-separated integers $matrix[i][j]$.

## Constraints

- $0 \lt n, m \lt 10$

## Sample Input

STDIN       Function
-----       --------
4           n = 4
4           m = 4
1 1 0 0     grid = [[1, 1, 1, 0], [0, 1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0]]
0 1 1 0
0 0 1 0
1 0 0 0

## Explanation

The diagram below depicts two regions of the matrix.  Connected regions are filled with X or Y.  Zeros are replaced with dots for clarity.

X X . .
. X X .
. . X .
Y . . .

The larger region has  cells, marked X.
