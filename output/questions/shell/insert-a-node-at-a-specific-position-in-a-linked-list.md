## Problem Statement

<sub>This challenge is part of a tutorial track by [MyCodeSchool](http://www.youtube.com/mycodeschool) and is accompanied by a video lesson.</sub>

Given a pointer to the head node of a linked list and an integer to insert at a certain position, create a new node with the given integer as its $data$ attribute, insert this node at the desired position, and return the head node.

A position of 0 indicates the head, a position of 1 indicates one node away from the head, and so on. The head pointer given may be null, meaning that the initial list is empty.    

**Example**  
$head$ refers to the first node in the list $1 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 3$  
$data = 4$  
$position = 2$  

Insert a node at position $2$ with $data = 4$.  The new list is $1 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow 3$

**Function Description**  
Complete the function $insertNodeAtPosition$ with the following parameters:

-  $SinglyLinkedListNode\ pointer\ llist$: a reference to the head of the list
-  $data$: an integer value to insert as data in the new node
-  $position$: an integer position to insert the new node, zero-based indexing  

**Returns**  

-  $SinglyLinkedListNode\ pointer$: a reference to the head of the revised list  

## Input Format

The first line contains an integer $n$, the number of elements in the linked list.  
Each of the next $n$ lines contains an integer SinglyLinkedListNode[i].data.  
The next line contains an integer $data$, the data of the node that is to be inserted.  
The last line contains an integer $position$.



## Constraints

- $ 1 \le n \le 1000$  
- $ 1 \le SinglyLinkedListNode[i].data \le 1000$, where $SinglyLinkedListNode[i]$ is the $i^{th}$ element of the linked list.  
- $ 0 \le position \le n$.  


## Sample Input

STDIN   Function
-----   --------
3       n = 3
16      llist = 16->13->7
13
7
1       data = 1
2       position = 2

## Sample Output

16 13 1 7

## Explanation

The initial linked list is . Insert  at the position  which currently has  in it. The updated linked list is .
