## Problem Statement

**Objective**	
In this challenge, we practice calculating the *mean*, *median*, and *mode*. Check out the [Tutorial](/challenges/s10-basic-statistics/tutorial) tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

**Task**	
Given an array, $X$, of $N$ integers, calculate and print the respective *mean*, *median*, and *mode* on separate lines. If your array contains more than one *modal value*, choose the numerically smallest one.

**Note:** Other than the modal value (which will always be an integer), your answers should be in decimal form, rounded to a scale of $1$ decimal place (i.e., $12.3$, $7.0$ format).  

**Example**  
$N = 6$  
$X = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5]$  

The mean is $\frac{20}{6} = 3.3$.  
The median is $\frac{3+4}{2} = 3.5$.    
The mode is $5$ because $5$ occurs most frequently.  

## Input Format

The first line contains an integer, $N$, the number of elements in the array. 	
The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers that describe the array's elements.

## Output Format

Print $3$ lines of output in the following order:

1. Print the *mean* on the first line to a scale of $1$ decimal place (i.e., $12.3$, $7.0$).
2. Print the *median* on a new line, to a scale of $1$ decimal place (i.e., $12.3$, $7.0$).
3. Print the *mode* on a new line. If more than one such value exists, print the numerically smallest one.

## Constraints

- $10 \le N \le 2500$  
- $0 \lt x[i]  \le 10^5$, where $x[i]$ is the $i^{th}$ element of the array.

## Sample Input

64630 11735 14216 99233 14470 4978 73429 38120 51135 67060

## Sample Output

43900.6
44627.5
4978

## Explanation

Mean:

We sum all  elements in the array, divide the sum by , and print our result on a new line.

Median:

To calculate the median, we need the elements of the array to be sorted in either non-increasing or non-decreasing order. The sorted array . We then average the two middle elements:

and print our result on a new line.

Mode:

We can find the number of occurrences of all the elements in the array:

 4978 : 1
11735 : 1
14216 : 1
14470 : 1
38120 : 1
51135 : 1
64630 : 1
67060 : 1
73429 : 1
99233 : 1

Every number occurs once, making  the maximum number of occurrences for any number in . Because we have multiple values to choose from, we want to select the smallest one, , and print it on a new line.
