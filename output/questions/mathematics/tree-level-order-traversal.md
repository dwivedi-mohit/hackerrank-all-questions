## Problem Statement

Given a pointer to the root of a binary tree, you need to print the level order traversal of this tree. In level-order traversal, nodes are visited level by level from left to right. Complete the function $levelOrder$ and print the values in a single line separated by a space.

For example:

         1
    	  \
		   2
			\
			 5
			/  \
		   3    6
			\
			 4	

For the above tree, the level order traversal is $1 -> 2 -> 5 -> 3 -> 6 -> 4$.


## Input Format

You are given a function,

	void levelOrder(Node * root) {
    	
    }

## Output Format

Print the values in a single line separated by a space.

## Constraints

$1$ $\leq$Nodes in the tree  $\leq$ $500$

## Sample Input

\
       2
        \
         5
        /  \
       3    6
        \
         4

## Sample Output

1 2 5 3 6 4

## Explanation

We need to print the nodes level by level. We process each level from left to right.
