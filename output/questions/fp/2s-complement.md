## Problem Statement

Understanding [*$2$'s complement*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement) representation is fundamental to learning about Computer Science. It allows us to write negative numbers in binary.  The leftmost digit is used as a sign bit.  If it is $1$, we have a negative number and it is represented as the two's complement of its absolute value.  Let's say you wrote down the $2$'s complement representation for each $32$-bit integer in the inclusive range from $a$ to $b$.  How many $1$'s would you write down in all?  

For example, using an $8$-bit byte rather than $32$ bit integer, the two's complement of a number can be found by reversing all its bits and adding $1$.  The two's complement representations for a few numbers are shown below:  
			
            |Number|				Representation in
	Number	 Binary		Inverse		Two's Complement
    -3		00000011	11111100	11111101
    -2		00000010	11111101	11111110
    -1		00000001	11111110	11111111
     0		00000000				00000000
     1		00000001				00000001
     2		00000010				00000010
     3		00000011				00000011
     
To write down that range of numbers' two's complements in $8$ bits, we wrote $26\ 1$'s.  Remember to use $32$ bits rather than $8$ in your solution.  The logic is the same, so the $8$ bit representation was chosen to reduce apparent complexity in the example.  

**Function Description**  

Complete the *twosCompliment* function in the editor below.  It should return an integer.  

twosCompliment has the following parameter(s):  
- *a*: an integer, the range minimum  
- *b*: an integer, the range maximum  

## Input Format

The first line contains an integer $T$, the number of test cases.   

Each of the next $T$ lines contains two space-separated integers, $a$ and $b$.  

## Output Format

For each test case, print the number of $1$'s in the $32$-bit $2$'s complement representation for integers in the inclusive range from $a$ to $b$ on a new line.

## Constraints

- $T \leq 1000$
- $-2^{31} \leq a \leq b \leq 2^{31} - 1$

## Sample Input

3
-2 0
-3 4
-1 4

## Sample Output

63
99
37

## Explanation

Test case 0

-2 has 31 ones

-1 has 32 ones

0 has 0 ones

31+32+0 = 63

Test case 1

-3 has 31 ones

-2 has 31 ones

-1 has 32 ones

0 has 0 ones

1 has 1 ones

2 has 1 ones

3 has 2 ones

4 has 1 ones

31+31+32+0+1+1+2+1 = 99

Test case 2

-1 has 32 ones

0 has 0 ones

1 has 1 ones

2 has 1 ones

3 has 2 ones

4 has 1 ones

32+0+1+1+2+1 = 37
