## Summary

This front-end development question evaluates React component state management, routing, and filtering concepts, ideal for senior-level roles. The problem requires completing a React application to ensure it meets specified functionalities and passes all unit tests.

## Problem Statement

Complete a partially completed React application as shown below to pass all the unit tests. Certain core React functionalities are already implemented.

The application should have the following functionalities:

 

	
- General Functionality
	
		
- The Ticket Board should:
		
			
- Display all tickets by default.
			
- Dynamically update the displayed tickets based on the selected filters.
		
		
	
	
	
- Routes
	
		
- 
		
Home Page (/):

		
			
- Display the Ticket Board with all tickets provided in src/tickets.json sorted by their due date in ascending order.
			
- Each ticket card should display the following:
			
				
- Ticket title.
				
- Assigned agent name.
				
- Due date.
				
- Current status.
			
			
		
		
		
- 
		
Ticket Details (/ticket/:id):

		
			
- Clicking the View Details button should navigate to the above route and display the selected ticket's details, including:

			
				
- Description.
				
- Current status with a dropdown to change it.
			
			
			
- Include a Back to Board button to return to the Ticket Board.
		
		
	
	
	
- Filtering
	
		
- Add dropdown filters on the Ticket Board:
		
			
- Filter by Status should include:
			
				
- All.
				
- Open.
				
- In Progress.
				
- Resolved.
			
			
			
- Filter by Agent should include:
			
				
- All.
				
- Unique agent names are dynamically populated from the tickets.
			
			
		
		
		
- When a filter combination results in no matching tickets:
		
			
- Display a message: "No tickets found.".
		
		
	
	
	
- Status Updates
	
		
- On the Ticket Details page:
		
			
- The ticket’s status should be changeable using a dropdown.
			
- A Save Changes button should be provided to persist the updated status.
			
- After saving, display an alert "Ticket status has been updated successfully!" confirming the status change.
			
- Ensure the following behavior:
			
				
- If the status is changed and saved, the Ticket Board reflects the updated status.
				
- If the status is changed but not saved, the Ticket Board reflects the original status upon returning.
			
			
		
		
	
	

The following data-testid attributes are required in the component for the tests to pass:

 

	Table of data-testid
	
		
			Attribute
			Component
		
	
	
		
			ticket-board
			Component displaying the Ticket Board.
		
		
			filter-status
			Dropdown for filtering tickets by status.
		
		
			filter-agent
			Dropdown for filtering tickets by agent.
		
		
			tickets
			Container for the list of filtered tickets.
		
		
			no-tickets-found
			Message displayed when no tickets are found on changing the filters
		
		
			ticket-card
			
			
			
			Individual ticket card displaying ticket details.

			
			
			
		
		
			ticket-details
			Component displaying details of a selected ticket.
		
		
			change-status
			Dropdown to change the status of a ticket.
		
		
			save-changes-btn
			Button to save changes to the ticket's status.
		
		
			back-to-board-btn
			Button to navigate back to the Ticket Board.
		
	

 

Note:

	
- Components have data-testid attributes for test cases and certain classes and IDs for rendering purposes. They should not be changed.
	
- All the tickets are provided in the file src/tickets.json.
	
- The files that should be modified are src/components/Main.js, src/components/TicketBoard.js, src/components/TicketCard.js, src/components/TicketDetails.js, and src/context/TicketContext.js. They are open by default in the system editor.
	
- Avoid making changes to other files in the project structure.
