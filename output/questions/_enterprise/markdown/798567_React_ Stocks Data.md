## Summary

This front-end development question evaluates React, API integration, and data rendering concepts, ideal for mid-level roles. The problem requires creating a stocks data component that fetches and displays stock information based on user-inputted dates.

## Problem Statement

Create a stocks data component as shown.

 

  
    
      Hide animation
      Show animation
    
    
      
    
  
  

 

The component must have the following functionalities.

	
- 
	
The input should initially be empty. The user can type a date in this input box, for which the stock data must be searched. The date format must be d-mmmm-yyyy (e.g., 5-January-2000).

	
	
- 
	
Clicking on the 'Search' button should make an API GET call to URL 'https://jsonmock.hackerrank.com/api/stocks?date={input}' using the JavaScript fetch API, specifically the fetch function. Here, {input} is the date entered into the text box. For example, for date 5-January-2000, the API hit is https://jsonmock.hackerrank.com/api/stocks?date=5-January-2000. The date passed to the URL must not have any leading zeroes in the day.

	
	
- 
	
The response will contain a data field that contains stock data.

	

`"data": [
    {
      "date": "5-January-2000",
      "open": 5265.09,
      "high": 5464.35,
      "low": 5184.48,
      "close": 5357
    }
  ]`
```

	

 

The data field is an array that contains a single object. Retrieve the open, close, high, and low values from this, and render it in the format explained.

	
- 
	
Display the data inside <ul data-testid="stock-data"></ul>. This list will have these list elements in this order.

	
		
- 
		
<li>Open: {open}</li> , where {open} is the open value from data above

		
		
- 
		
<li>Close: {close}</li> , where {close} is the close value

		
		
- 
		
<li>High: {high}</li> , where {high} is the high value

		
		
- 
		
<li>Low: {low}</li> , where {low} is the low value

		
	
	
	
- 
	
The element <ul data-testid="stock-data"></ul> is rendered only when data is fetched and the result is shown. Initially, it is not rendered since no API has been hit yet.

	
	
- 
	
If the API returns no stock data, the app should render <div data-testid="no-result">No Results Found</div> instead of the <ul> element. This element should be visible only when the data field is an empty array. This div should not be rendered initially because no API has been hit yet.

	
	
- 
	
Note that the input field accepts the date as text. Input will be tested only with valid dates, so writing input validation is not required.

	

 

The following data-testid attributes are required in the component for the tests to pass:

	
- 
	
Input should have the data-testid attribute 'app-input'.

	
	
- 
	
Search button should have the data-testid attribute 'submit-button'.

	
	
- 
	
<ul> should have the data-testid attribute 'stock-data'.

	
	
- 
	
The 'No Results Found' div should have the data-testid attribute 'no-result'.

	

 

Note that components have data-testid attributes for test cases and certain classes and ids for rendering purposes. These should not be changed.
