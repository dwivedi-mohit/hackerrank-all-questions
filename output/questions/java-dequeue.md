## Problem Statement

In computer science, a double-ended queue (dequeue, often abbreviated to deque, pronounced deck) is an abstract data type that generalizes a queue, for which elements can be added  to or removed from either the front (head) or back (tail).

    
Deque interfaces can be implemented using various types of collections such as `LinkedList` or `ArrayDeque` classes. For example, deque can be declared as:

    Deque deque = new LinkedList<>();
    or
    Deque deque = new ArrayDeque<>();
    
You can find more details about Deque [here](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Deque.html).

In this problem, you are given $N$ integers. You need to find the maximum number of unique integers among all the possible contiguous subarrays of size $M$.

*Note*: Time limit is $3$ second for this problem.


## Input Format

The first line of input contains two integers $N$ and $M$: representing the total number of integers and the size of the subarray, respectively. The next line contains $N$ space separated integers. 

**Constraints**

$1 \le N \le 100000$<br>
$1 \le M \le 100000$<br>
$M\le N$<br>
The numbers in the array will range between $[0,10000000]$.


## Output Format

Print the *maximum* number of unique integers among all possible contiguous subarrays of size $M$.

## Constraints

The numbers in the array will range between .

## Sample Input

6 3
5 3 5 2 3 2

## Explanation

In the sample testcase, there are 4 subarrays of contiguous numbers.

 - Has  unique numbers.

 - Has  unique numbers.

 - Has  unique numbers.

 - Has  unique numbers.

In these subarrays, there are  unique numbers, respectively. The maximum amount of unique numbers among all possible contiguous subarrays is .
