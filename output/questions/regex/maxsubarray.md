## Problem Statement

We define *subsequence* as any subset of an array.  We define a *subarray* as a *contiguous subsequence* in an array.  

Given an array, find the maximum possible sum among:

1. all nonempty subarrays. 
2. all nonempty subsequences. 

Print the two values as space-separated integers on one line. 

**Note** that empty subarrays/subsequences should not be considered. 

**Example**  
$arr = [-1, 2, 3, -4, 5, 10]$   

The maximum subarray sum is comprised of elements at inidices $[1-5]$.  Their sum is $2 + 3 + -4 + 5 + 10 = 16$.  The maximum subsequence sum is comprised of elements at indices $[1, 2, 4, 5]$ and their sum is $2 + 3 + 5 + 10 = 20$.  

**Function Description**  

Complete the *maxSubarray* function in the editor below.    

maxSubarray has the following parameter(s):  

- *int arr[n]:* an array of integers  

**Returns**  

- *int[2]:* the maximum subarray and subsequence sums  

## Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer $t$, the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$.   
The second line contains $n$ space-separated integers $arr[i]$ where $0 \le i \lt n$.   

## Constraints

- $1 \le t \le 10$
- $1 \le n \le 10^5$   
- $-10^4 \le arr[i] \le 10^4$   


*The subarray and subsequences you consider should have at least one element.*

## Sample Input

2
4
1 2 3 4
6
2 -1 2 3 4 -5

## Sample Output

10 10
10 11

## Explanation

In the first case: The maximum sum for both types of subsequences is just the sum of all the elements since they are all positive.

In the second case: The subarray  is the subarray with the maximum sum, and  is the subsequence with the maximum sum.
