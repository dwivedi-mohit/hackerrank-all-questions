## Problem Statement

In this challenge you will create an efficient compression scheme to compress the works of Shakespeare.  


**An Introduction to our Compression Scheme**  

Given a large volume of text from the works of Shakespeare, only containing ASCII characters, your task, is to come up with an encoding scheme, which can compress the text efficiently. Let us take a small example.

Here is a small block of text from Wikipedia:  

    William Shakespeare was an English poet and playwright, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist. He is often called England's national poet and the "Bard of Avon". His extant works, including some collaborations, consist of about 38 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, the authorship of some of which is uncertain. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.
    Shakespeare was born and brought up in Stratford-upon-Avon. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna, and twins Hamnet and Judith. Between 1585 and 1592, he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part-owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men. He appears to have retired to Stratford around 1613 at age 49, where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare's private life survive, and there has been considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance, sexuality, religious beliefs, and whether the works attributed to him were written by others.  
    Shakespeare produced most of his known work between 1589 and 1613. His early plays were mainly comedies and histories, genres he raised to the peak of sophistication and artistry by the end of the 16th century. He then wrote mainly tragedies until about 1608, including Hamlet, King Lear, Othello, and Macbeth, considered some of the finest works in the English language. In his last phase, he wrote tragicomedies, also known as romances, and collaborated with other playwrights.
    Many of his plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy during his lifetime. In 1623, John Heminges and Henry Condell, two friends and fellow actors of Shakespeare, published the First Folio, a collected edition of his dramatic works that included all but two of the plays now recognised as Shakespeare's. It was prefaced with a poem by Ben Jonson, in which Shakespeare is hailed, presciently, as "not of an age, but for all time."
    Shakespeare was a respected poet and playwright in his own day, but his reputation did not rise to its present heights until the 19th century. The Romantics, in particular, acclaimed Shakespeare's genius, and the Victorians worshipped Shakespeare with a reverence that George Bernard Shaw called "bardolatry".[8] In the 20th century, his work was repeatedly adopted and rediscovered by new movements in scholarship and performance. His plays remain highly popular today and are constantly studied, performed, and reinterpreted in diverse cultural and political contexts throughout the world.
    
    
Its usual encoding in the form of bits is given as follows. Every character is converted to the 8-bit representation of its ASCII code. For instance, the ASCII code in decimal for 'a' is 97. In binary, this is 01100001. Simiarly, the encoded representation for 'William' is '01010111011010010110110001101100011010010110000101101101' (a concatenation of the 8-bit representation for the ASCII represeentation of the characters W, i, l, l, i, a, m respectively). Proceeding in this manner, the encoding for the entire block of text given above will appear as shown below. The total number of bits required, will be the number of characters in the text block, multiplied by 8 (i.e. 8N). Remember that spaces, punctuation, newline: everything counts as a character.  
There are 2756 characters in the text block above, and a total of 2756 * 8 = 22048 bits are used while representing it in this way.   

    010101110110100101101100011011000110100101100001011011010010000001010011011010000110000101101011011001010111001101110000011001010110000101110010011001010010000001110111011000010111001100100000011000010110111000100000010001010110111001100111011011000110100101110011011010000010000001110000011011110110010101110100001000000110000101101110011001000010000001110000011011000110000101111001011101110111001001101001011001110110100001110100001011000010000001110111011010010110010001100101011011000111100100100000011100100110010101100111011000010111001001100100011001010110010000100000011000010111001100100000011101000110100001100101001000000110011101110010011001010110000101110100011001010111001101110100001000000111011101110010011010010111010001.................................


As you might observe above, each character has simply been replaced by its 8-bit ASCII Code in binary representation. **Now, let us define a modified form of encoding, which permits us to encode a given block of text, in fewer bits. i.e, this kind of encoding will help us compress a given block of text.**    

This form of encoding can contain two kinds of codes: Codes which are 9-bit in length or 17-bits in length.  

	(1) 9-bit codes should begin with a zero (eg. 011111100). These codes represent the 256 ASCII characters, in 9-bits. For example, the ASCII code for 'a' is 97, so its 9-bit representation is 001100001. The interpretation of these 9-bit codes is already fixed and known, and should not be changed.  
	(2) 17-bit codes should begin with a one. (eg. 10000000111111110)  
    (3) Each 17-bit code can either represent one character, or it could represent a string of characters. (For eg. '11100001000000011' could represent 'b', '11100001000000001' could represent 'Shakespeare' and so on). 
    (4) '1000000001' and '00101111100000001' are examples of invalid codes. The former is a 9-bit code so the first bit on the left should have been zero. The latter is a 17-bit code so the first bit on the left should have been one.
    
    
**Using this form of encoding, we define a set of codes.**  

**The interpretation of the 9-bit codes is fixed as per the ASCII chart, and should not be changed.**

 In deference to space, we won't display all the 9-bit codes, but we have 256 such codes, and each one of them is simply an extra zero prefixed to the 8-bit ASCII representation of the character it corresponds to. For example, 'a' is 97 in ASCII, which is 01100001 in binary; we prefix a zero to this to obtain our 9-bit code for 'a' => '001100001'.
We have a total of 256 codes which are 9-bit long and 23 codes which are 17-bit long.  

Using this encoding, the block of text from Shakespeare's biography, now encodes as:

'Shakespeare' has been replaced by '10000000000000001', 'English' has been replaced by '10000111111111100' and so on - as per our encoding scheme. 

**We now find, that the block of text, can be represented in 21898 bits, using this particular manner of encoding; as opposed to the 22048 bits required by the previous representation. (The size of the encoding-decoding dictionary we develop is not included here.)**  


Given a large input text file, with one of Shakespeare's works, or a portion of it, your task is to develop an encoding scheme, on the lines of the one shown above, which represents the text, in as few bits as possible. i.e., your primary challenge is to develop the codes in such a way, that you can represent the text given to you, such that it can be encoded into much fewer bits than its original representation.  

**Input Format** 

    A large input text file, with one of Shakespeare's works, or a portion of it.
    
    
**Output Format**  
    
    The first line should contain an integer N. This will indicate the number of different 17-bit codes which you have chosen to use.  
    This is followed by N lines of the encoding dictionary. Each line contains a character or a string, followed by a tab character, and a 17 bit code which will encode that character or string.
    The last line of your output should contain just one line which is the encoded version of the input text, using the encoding scheme determined by you. This should contain only zeroes and ones.    
    So, totally, there should be N + 2 lines in your file.
    
**Please note that the "expected output" which you see on hitting the "Compile and Test" button is what your bit string should decompress into** on using your encoding dictionary. This of course, is same as the input file (i.e. one of the works of Shakespeare). What your program should output, is the output format we have specified. Our grader will handle the de-compression/de-coding part.*     
    
    
**Sample Input**

**Constraints and Restrictions**  

All test cases have been selected from the works of Shakespeare available on Project Gutenberg. Only the sample text fragment is from Wikipedia.  
Only ASCII Characters are present in the file. No text file will contain more than 300k characters.  
Please avoid generating 17-bit encodings for strings which contain non-print/feed/control characters (such as newline, tab, form feed etc.). This could possibly lead to inaccuracies in grading.  
**You should use the same encoding dictionary across all the test cases.**
Machine Learning libraries are **not** available for this challenge.

 **Explanation**  
 10000000000000001 can be de-coded to Shakespeare. 10000011111111100 can be de-coded to 'known'. '001100001' can be decoded to the character 'a', an so on. On decoding the long string of bits in the last line, we will get back the original block of text from Wikipedia.  
    
    

**Scoring**  

Even though compression is accomplished only when you have less than 8N bits, we have relaxed the grading criteria to assign a positive score to those with less than 9N bits. The 9N bits is the number of bits which will be used when every character is replaced by its 9 bit code.  

If the input text has N characters, and if your encoding scheme successfully represents that text block with B bits, if B > (9N) the score for the test case will be zero, otherwise, the score for a test case will be:  

      M * ( 1 - B/9N)  
      Where M is the maximum score for the test.
      All test cases carry an equal weightage.  
      

Our custom checker will cross check that the encoded representation in the output, matches exactly with the original input, on using the encoding scheme generated by your solution. Representations which do not match exactly with the original input file will result in a zero score for the test case. In case your text contains a code which is neither available in the encoding dictionary provided by you, nor is it a 9-bit representation of one of the ASCII characters, you will be assigned a zero score for that test case.    



**Resources:**  

Here are some of the works from Project Gutenberg.

You could use these resources for working on a compression model offline and create an encoding dictionary. **You should use the same encoding dictionary across all the test cases.** All test files have been selected from Shakespeare's works on Project Gutenberg. 

**Moderator Note and Hint**  

Originally we had declared that the dictionary could be either the same for all tests, or you could create a separate one for each test if you wished. The second option left open a tricky situation where a contestant can wrap up the entire test case in one code and achieve almost 100% compression for the final output string. And the observant ones need full credit for spotting this loophole and using it in their solutions. This does defeat the purpose of compression though – since this actually results in an expansion of the original data.  

Our grader is going to be tightened a bit and we are going to permit that the same dictionary is submitted for all test cases. The dictionary size though, won’t be directly factored into the score - after all, the same dictionary, could be used to decompress a hundred encoded works of Shakespeare. We also highly recommend that you do take a look at the links to the works of Shakespeare linked in the problem - we have seen this information hasn’t been used by most of those who made submissions; based on which you can develop an efficient encoding scheme offline. The most important part of the code you submit to use will be the map or array of encodings you have arrived at (and how you apply it to the given text). This will also mean, that you will be able to use more resource-intensive algorithms which could lead to better compression ratios - which would not have otherwise run within the time/memory constraints of our environment. And a hint: those of you with NLP or Computational Linguistics toolkits installed on your local developer environment should consider using those and take advantage of Language Modelling techniques.

**Template Code for a Solution based on Unigram Frequencies**  

Please note that this is a Ruby template, provided for your convenience. For those who have decided to encode text using a Unigram model (or word frequences) all you need to do is to fill up the map named 'encoding' with your encodings. No knowledge of Ruby is required, all that needs to be done is to fill up the map. Unigrams might not be the best possible compression method, but they will be able to compress the text to some extent.  

<pre>

# Fill up this list with words which occur frequently in the works of Shakespeare. The keys should only be strings which represent One word - containing nothing other than letters, numerals and apostrope marks. 
# Build a Unigram model from the Shakespeare Resources mentioned in the problem statement and enter the most popular words in this list.


# --FILL UP THE LIST OF WORDS HERE ---
# --The number of elements in this list should not exceed 2^16 ---
# Words shoud only contain lower or upper case letters (A-Z or a-z)  
encodingList = ["the","an","and","Shakespeare"....]


# Do NOT edit the code below this line
encoding = {}

(0..encodingList.length-1).each{|x|
	encoding[encodingList[x]] = (2**16+x).to_s(2)	
}


def bitrep(x)
 rep = x.ord.to_s(2)
 if rep.length < 8
	return (1..(8-rep.length)).map{|x|"0"}.join("") + rep

 end

end

puts encoding.keys.length
encoding.each{|k,v|puts "#{k}\t#{v}"}
text = STDIN.read
tokens = text.split(/\b/)
puts tokens.map{|token|

	x = encoding[token]
	if x == nil
		x =token.split('').map{|x| "0#{bitrep(x)}"}.join("")

		x = encoding[token]
	end
	x

## Input Format

A large input text file, with one of Shakespeare's works, or a portion of it.

## Output Format

The first line should contain an integer N. This will indicate the number of different 17-bit codes which you have chosen to use.
This is followed by N lines of the encoding dictionary. Each line contains a character or a string, followed by a tab character, and a 17 bit code which will encode that character or string.
The last line of your output should contain just one line which is the encoded version of the input text, using the encoding scheme determined by you. This should contain only zeroes and ones.
So, totally, there should be N + 2 lines in your file.

Please note that the "expected output" which you see on hitting the "Compile and Test" button is what your bit string should decompress into on using your encoding dictionary. This of course, is same as the input file (i.e. one of the works of Shakespeare). What your program should output, is the output format we have specified. Our grader will handle the de-compression/de-coding part.*

## Sample Input

## Explanation

10000000000000001 can be de-coded to Shakespeare. 10000011111111100 can be de-coded to 'known'. '001100001' can be decoded to the character 'a', an so on. On decoding the long string of bits in the last line, we will get back the original block of text from Wikipedia.

Scoring

Even though compression is accomplished only when you have less than 8N bits, we have relaxed the grading criteria to assign a positive score to those with less than 9N bits. The 9N bits is the number of bits which will be used when every character is replaced by its 9 bit code.

If the input text has N characters, and if your encoding scheme successfully represents that text block with B bits, if B > (9N) the score for the test case will be zero, otherwise, the score for a test case will be:

  M * ( 1 - B/9N)
  Where M is the maximum score for the test.
  All test cases carry an equal weightage.

Our custom checker will cross check that the encoded representation in the output, matches exactly with the original input, on using the encoding scheme generated by your solution. Representations which do not match exactly with the original input file will result in a zero score for the test case. In case your text contains a code which is neither available in the encoding dictionary provided by you, nor is it a 9-bit representation of one of the ASCII characters, you will be assigned a zero score for that test case.

Resources:

Here are some of the works from Project Gutenberg.

The Taming of the Shrew

A Midsummer Night Dream

The Merchant of Venice

You could use these resources for working on a compression model offline and create an encoding dictionary. You should use the same encoding dictionary across all the test cases. All test files have been selected from Shakespeare's works on Project Gutenberg.

Moderator Note and Hint

Originally we had declared that the dictionary could be either the same for all tests, or you could create a separate one for each test if you wished. The second option left open a tricky situation where a contestant can wrap up the entire test case in one code and achieve almost 100% compression for the final output string. And the observant ones need full credit for spotting this loophole and using it in their solutions. This does defeat the purpose of compression though – since this actually results in an expansion of the original data.

Our grader is going to be tightened a bit and we are going to permit that the same dictionary is submitted for all test cases. The dictionary size though, won’t be directly factored into the score - after all, the same dictionary, could be used to decompress a hundred encoded works of Shakespeare. We also highly recommend that you do take a look at the links to the works of Shakespeare linked in the problem - we have seen this information hasn’t been used by most of those who made submissions; based on which you can develop an efficient encoding scheme offline. The most important part of the code you submit to use will be the map or array of encodings you have arrived at (and how you apply it to the given text). This will also mean, that you will be able to use more resource-intensive algorithms which could lead to better compression ratios - which would not have otherwise run within the time/memory constraints of our environment. And a hint: those of you with NLP or Computational Linguistics toolkits installed on your local developer environment should consider using those and take advantage of Language Modelling techniques.

Template Code for a Solution based on Unigram Frequencies

Please note that this is a Ruby template, provided for your convenience. For those who have decided to encode text using a Unigram model (or word frequences) all you need to do is to fill up the map named 'encoding' with your encodings. No knowledge of Ruby is required, all that needs to be done is to fill up the map. Unigrams might not be the best possible compression method, but they will be able to compress the text to some extent.

# Fill up this list with words which occur frequently in the works of Shakespeare. The keys should only be strings which represent One word - containing nothing other than letters, numerals and apostrope marks.
# Build a Unigram model from the Shakespeare Resources mentioned in the problem statement and enter the most popular words in this list.

# --FILL UP THE LIST OF WORDS HERE ---
# --The number of elements in this list should not exceed 2^16 ---
# Words shoud only contain lower or upper case letters (A-Z or a-z)
encodingList = ["the","an","and","Shakespeare"....]

# Do NOT edit the code below this line
encoding = {}

(0..encodingList.length-1).each{|x|
    encoding[encodingList[x]] = (2**16+x).to_s(2)
}

def bitrep(x)
 rep = x.ord.to_s(2)
 if rep.length
