## Problem Statement

Given an array of stick lengths, use $3$ of them to construct a [non-degenerate triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneracy_(mathematics)#Triangle) with the maximum possible perimeter. Return an array of the lengths of its sides as $3$ integers in non-decreasing order.

If there are several valid triangles having the maximum perimeter: 

1. Choose the one with the *longest maximum side*. 
2. If more than one has that maximum, choose from them the one with the *longest minimum side*. 
3. If more than one has that maximum as well, print any one them.

If no non-degenerate triangle exists, return $[-1]$.

**Example**   
$sticks = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10]$   

The triplet $(1,2,3)$ will not form a triangle.  Neither will $(4,5,10)$ or $(2,3,5)$, so the problem is reduced to $(2,3,4)$ and $(3,4,5)$.  The longer perimeter is $3+4+5=12$.  

**Function Description**  

Complete the *maximumPerimeterTriangle* function in the editor below.  

maximumPerimeterTriangle has the following parameter(s):  

- *int sticks[n]:* the lengths of sticks available   

**Returns**   

- *int[3] or int[1]:*  the side lengths of the chosen triangle in non-decreasing order or -1    

## Input Format

The first line contains single integer $n$, the size of array $sticks$.		
The second line contains $n$ space-separated integers $sticks[i]$, each a stick length.


## Output Format

  

## Constraints

- $3 \le n \le 50$
- $1 \le sticks[i] \le 10^9$


## Explanation

Sample Case 0:

There are  possible unique triangles:

-

-

The second triangle has the largest perimeter, so we print its side lengths on a new line in non-decreasing order.

Sample Case 1:

The triangle  is degenerate and thus can't be constructed, so we print -1 on a new line.
