## Problem Statement

In a tag-based language like *XML* or *HTML*, contents are enclosed between a *start tag* and an *end tag* like `<tag>contents</tag>`. Note that the corresponding *end tag* starts with a `/`.

Given a string of text in a tag-based language, parse this text and retrieve the contents enclosed within sequences of well-organized tags meeting the following criterion:

1. The name of the *start* and *end* tags must be same. The HTML code `<h1>Hello World</h2>` is *not valid*, because the text starts with an `h1` tag and ends with a non-matching `h2` tag.

2. Tags can be nested, but content between nested tags is considered *not valid*. For example, in `<h1><a>contents</a>invalid</h1>`, `contents` is *valid* but `invalid` is *not valid*.
        
3. Tags can consist of any printable characters.



## Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer, $N$ (the number of lines). 	
The $N$ subsequent lines each contain a line of text.

**Constraints**  

- $1 \leq N \leq 100$	
- Each line contains a maximum of $10^4$ printable characters. 	
- The total number of characters in all test cases will not exceed $10^6$.



## Output Format

For each line, print the content enclosed within valid tags. 	
If a line contains multiple instances of valid content, print out each instance of valid content on a new line; if no valid content is found, print `None`.

## Constraints

-

- Each line contains a maximum of  printable characters.

- The total number of characters in all test cases will not exceed .
