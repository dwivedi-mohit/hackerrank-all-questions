## Problem Statement

Consider a string of $n$ characters, $s$, of where each character is indexed from $0$ to $n-1$.

You are given $q$ queries in the form of two integer indices: $left$ and $right$. For each query, count and print the number of different substrings of $s$ in the inclusive range between $left$ and $right$. 

**Note:** Two substrings are *different* if their sequence of characters differs by at least one. For example, given the string $s = $ `aab`, substrings $s_{[0,0]} = $ `a` and $s_{[1,1]} = $ `a` are the same but substrings $s_{[0,1]} = $ `aa` and $s_{[1,2]} = $ `ab` are different.

## Input Format

The first line contains two space-separated integers describing the respective values of $n$ and $q$.		
The second line contains a single string denoting $s$.		
Each of the $q$ subsequent lines contains two space-separated integers describing the respective values of $left$ and $right$ for a query.

## Output Format

For each query, print the number of different substrings in the inclusive range between index $left$ and index $right$ on a new line. 

## Constraints

+ $0\leq left \leq right \leq n-1$  
+ String $s$ consists of lowercase English alphabetic letters (i.e., `a` to `z`) only.

**Subtasks**  

+ For $30\%$ of the test cases, $1 \leq n, q \leq 100$  
+ For $50\%$ of the test cases, $1 \leq n, q \leq 3000$  
+ For $100\%$ of the test cases, $1 \leq n, q \leq 10^5$  

## Sample Input

1 4

## Sample Output

## Explanation

Given  aabaa, we perform the following  queries:

- 1 1: The only substring of a is itself, so we print  on a new line.

- 1 4: The substrings of abaa are a, b, ab, ba, aa, aba, baa, and abaa, so we print  on a new line.

- 1 1: The only substring of a is itself, so we print  on a new line.

- 1 4: The substrings of abaa are a, b, ab, ba, aa, aba, baa, and abaa, so we print  on a new line.

- 0 2: The substrings of aab are a, b, aa, ab, and aab, so we print  on a new line.
