## Problem Statement

Use the counting sort to order a list of strings associated with integers. If two strings are associated with the same integer, they must be printed in their original order, i.e. your sorting algorithm should be _stable_.  There is one other twist: strings in the first half of the array are to be replaced with the character `-` (dash, ascii 45 decimal).

Insertion Sort and the simple version of Quicksort are stable, but the faster in-place version of Quicksort is not since it scrambles around elements while sorting. 

Design your counting sort to be stable. 

**Example**   
$arr = \text{[[0,'a'],[1,'b'],[0,'c'],[1,'d']]}$    

The first two strings are replaced with '-'.  Since the maximum associated integer is $1$, set up a helper array with at least two empty arrays as elements.  The following shows the insertions into an array of three empty arrays.

```
i	string	converted	list
0				[[],[],[]]
1 	a 	-		[[-],[],[]]
2	b	-		[[-],[-],[]]
3	c			[[-,c],[-],[]]
4	d			[[-,c],[-,d],[]]
```
The result is then printed: $\text{- c - d}$ . 

**Function Description**  

Complete the *countSort* function in the editor below.  It should construct and print the sorted strings.  

countSort has the following parameter(s):

- *string arr[n][2]:* each *arr[i]* is comprised of two strings, *x* and *s*  

**Returns**  
- Print the finished array with each element separated by a single space.

**Note**: The first element of each $arr[i]$, $x$, must be cast as an integer to perform the sort.  

## Input Format

The first line contains $n$, the number of integer/string pairs in the array $arr$.  
Each of the next $n$ contains $x[i]$ and $s[i]$, the integers (as strings) with their associated strings.
 

## Output Format

Print the strings in their correct order, space-separated on one line. 

## Constraints

$1 \le n \le 1000000$   
$n$ is even  
$1 \le |s| \le 10$  
$0 \le x \lt 100, x ∈ ar$   
$s[i]$ consists of characters in the range $\text{ascii[a-z]}$
 

## Sample Input

0 ab
6 cd
0 ef
6 gh
4 ij
0 ab
6 cd
0 ef
6 gh
0 ij
4 that
3 be
0 to
1 be
5 question
1 or
2 not

4 the

## Sample Output

- - - - - to be or not to be - that is the question - - - -

## Explanation

The correct order is shown below. In the array at the bottom, strings from the first half of the original array were replaced with dashes.

0 ab
0 ef
0 ab
0 ef
0 ij
0 to
1 be
1 or
2 not
2 to
3 be
4 ij
4 that
4 is
4 the
5 question
6 cd
6 gh
6 cd
6 gh

sorted = [['-', '-', '-', '-', '-', 'to'], ['be', 'or'], ['not', 'to'], ['be'], ['-', 'that', 'is', 'the'], ['question'], ['-', '-', '-', '-'], [], [], [], []]
