## Problem Statement

HackerLand University has the following grading policy:

* Every student receives a $grade$ in the inclusive range from $0$ to $100$.
* Any $grade$ less than $40$ is a failing grade. 

Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student's $grade$ according to these rules:

* If the difference between the $grade$ and the next multiple of $5$ is less than $3$, round $grade$ up to the next multiple of $5$.
* If the value of $grade$ is less than $38$, no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.

**Examples**

- $grade = 84$ round to $85$ (85 - 84 is less than 3)  
- $grade = 29$ do not round (result is less than 38)  
- $grade = 57$ do not round (60 - 57 is 3 or higher)   

Given the initial value of $grade$ for each of Sam's $n$ students, write code to automate the rounding process.   

**Function Description**  

Complete the function $gradingStudents$ with the following parameter(s):  

- $int\ grades[n]$: the grades before rounding  

**Returns**

- $int[n]$: the grades after rounding

## Input Format

The first line contains a single integer, $n$, the number of students. 		
Each line $i$ of the $n$ subsequent lines contains a single integer, $grades[i]$.

## Constraints

* $ 1 \le n \le 60 $
* $ 0 \le grades[i] \le 100 $

## Explanation

- Student  received a , and the next multiple of  from  is . Since , the student's grade is rounded to .

- Student  received a , and the next multiple of  from  is . Since , the grade will not be modified and the student's final grade is .

- Student  received a , and the next multiple of  from  is . Since , the student's grade will be rounded to .

- Student  received a grade below , so the grade will not be modified and the student's final grade is .
