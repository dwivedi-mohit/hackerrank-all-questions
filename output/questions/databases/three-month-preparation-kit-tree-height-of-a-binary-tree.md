## Problem Statement

The height of a binary tree is the number of edges between the tree's root and its furthest leaf.  For example, the following binary tree is of height $2$:

**Function Description**

Complete the *getHeight* or *height* function in the editor.  It must return the height of a binary tree as an integer.

getHeight or height has the following parameter(s):

- *root*: a reference to the root of a binary tree.    

**Note** -The Height of binary tree with single node is taken as zero.  

## Input Format

The first line contains an integer $n$, the number of nodes in the tree.  
Next line contains $n$ space separated integer where $i$th integer denotes node[i].data.

**Note**:  Node values are inserted into a binary search tree before a reference to the tree's root node is passed to your function.  In a binary search tree, all nodes on the left branch of a node are less than the node value.  All values on the right branch are greater than the node value.


## Output Format

Your function should return a single integer denoting the height of the binary tree.

## Constraints

 $1 \le node.data[i] \le 20$  
 $1 \le n \le 20$

## Explanation

The longest root-to-leaf path is shown below:

There are  nodes in this path that are connected by  edges, meaning our binary tree's .
