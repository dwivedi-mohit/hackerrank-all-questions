## Problem Statement

Julia conducted a $15$ days of learning SQL contest. The start date of the contest was _March 01, 2016_ and the end date was _March 15, 2016_. 

Write a query to print total number of unique hackers who made at least $1$ submission each day (starting on the first day of the contest), and find the _hacker\_id_ and _name_ of the hacker who made maximum number of submissions each day. If more than one such hacker has a maximum number of submissions, print the lowest *hacker\_id*. The query should print this information for each day of the contest, sorted by the date.
