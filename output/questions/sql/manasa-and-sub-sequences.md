## Problem Statement

Manasa recently lost a bet to Amit. To settle the problem, they are playing a game:  

They have _N_ balls in front of them. Each ball, except the 1st ball, is numbered from 0 to 9. The 1st ball is numbered from 1 to 9. 

Amit calculates all the [subsequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsequence) of the number thus formed. Each subsequence of sequence _S_ is represented by _S<sub>k</sub>_. 

e.g. _S_ = 1 2 3  

_S<sub>0</sub>_ = 1 2 3 ,  
_S<sub>1</sub>_ = 1 2 ,  
_S<sub>2</sub>_ = 1 3 ,  
_S<sub>3</sub>_ = 2 3 ,  
_S<sub>4</sub>_ = 1 ,  
_S<sub>5</sub>_ = 2 , and  
_S<sub>6</sub>_ = 3 .  

Each subsequence _S<sub>k</sub>_ also represents a number. e.g. _S<sub>1</sub>_ represents tweleve, _S<sub>2</sub>_ represents thirteen.

Now Manasa has to throw _S<sub>k</sub>_ candies into an intially empty box, where _k_ goes from 0 to ( maximum number of subsequences -  1).

At the end of the game, Manasa has to find out the total number of candies, _T_, in the box. As _T_ can be large, Amit asks Manasa to tell _T % (10<sup>9</sup> + 7 )_. If Manasa answers correctly, she can keep all the candies. Manasa can't take all this Math and asks for your help.  

Help her!

*Note:* A subsequence can also be have preceding zeros. For example, the sequence _103_ has subsequences _103_, _10_, _13_, _03_, _1_, _0_, and _3_ (so both _03_ and _3_ are counted separately).

**Input Format**
