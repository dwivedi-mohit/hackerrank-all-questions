## Problem Statement

Maria plays college basketball and wants to go pro.  Each season she maintains a record of her play.  She tabulates the number of times she breaks her season record for *most points* and *least points* in a game.  Points scored in the first game establish her record for the season, and she begins counting from there.

**Example**  
$scores = [12, 24, 10, 24]$   

Scores are in the same order as the games played.  She tabulates her results as follows:

<pre>
									 Count
    Game  Score  Minimum  Maximum   Min Max
     0      12     12       12       0   0
     1      24     12       24       0   1
     2      10     10       24       1   1
     3      24     10       24       1   1
</pre>

Given the scores for a season, determine the number of times Maria breaks her records for *most* and *least* points scored during the season.

**Function Description**  

Complete the *breakingRecords* function in the editor below. 

breakingRecords has the following parameter(s):  

- *int scores[n]:* points scored per game   

**Returns**   

- *int[2]:* An array with the numbers of times she broke her records. Index $0$ is for breaking *most points* records, and index $1$ is for breaking *least points* records.  

## Input Format

The first line contains an integer $n$, the number of games.  		
The second line contains $n$ space-separated integers describing the respective values of $score_0, score_1, \ldots, score_{n-1}$.

## Output Format

  

## Constraints

* $1 \le n \le 1000$
* $0 \le scores[i] \le 10^8$

## Sample Input

9
10 5 20 20 4 5 2 25 1

## Sample Output

2 4

## Explanation

The diagram below depicts the number of times Maria broke her best and worst records throughout the season:

She broke her best record twice (after games  and ) and her worst record four times (after games , , , and ), so we print 2 4 as our answer. Note that she did not break her record for best score during game , as her score during that game was not strictly greater than her best record at the time.
