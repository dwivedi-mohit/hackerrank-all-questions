## Problem Statement

The Rebel Alliance and the Galactic Empire are engaged in an epic battle in the skies above Endor. The grand setup has d-dimensional board with each dimension of length 'N', (i.e) N x N... (d times). Each cell (i<sub>1</sub>, i<sub>2</sub>, ...i<sub>d</sub>) has the gcd (i<sub>1</sub>, i<sub>2</sub>, ...i<sub>d</sub>) written on it. 

Now, the game begins. A random integer <i>L</i> is chosen and the first person to sum up the L<sup>th</sup> power of each number modulo 30000001 wins the game. 

Rebel Alliance needs some help and pings you. If they win, you get a million dollars for it. Can you help?


**Input Format**

There are several test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases T. Then T test cases follow. Each test case is given in the following format.<br/>
N and d are given in the first Line.<br/>
Q is given in the second line.<br/>
Each of the next Q lines contain an integer L.

**Constraints**

0<=T<=10  
1<=N<=10<sup>7</sup>  
1<=d<=1000  
0<=L<=100  
0<=Q<=50  


**Output Format**

For each test case, output Q lines, indicating the answer.

**Explanation**

Test case1:  
the board is as follows:  

1(gcd 1,1)  1(gcd 1,2)  1(gcd 1,3)  
1(gcd 2,1)  2(gcd 2,2)  1(gcd 2,3)  
1(gcd 3,1)  1(gcd 3,2)  3(gcd 3,3)  

Therefore,
sum of 0th power is 1^0+1^0+1^0 + 1^0+2^0+1^0 + 1^0+1^0+3^0 = 9  
sum of 1st power is 1^1+1^1+1^1 + 1^1+2^1+1^1 + 1^1+1^1+3^1 = 12  
so on ...

Test case2:  
the board is as follows:  

1(gcd 1)  2(gcd 2)  3(gcd 3)  4(gcd 4)  5(gcd 5)

Therefore,  
sum of 0th power is 1^0+2^0+3^0+4^0+5^0 = 5  
sum of 1st power is 1^1+2^1+3^1+4^1+5^1 = 15  
so on ...

## Explanation

Test case1:

the board is as follows:

1(gcd 1,1)  1(gcd 1,2)  1(gcd 1,3)

1(gcd 2,1)  2(gcd 2,2)  1(gcd 2,3)

1(gcd 3,1)  1(gcd 3,2)  3(gcd 3,3)

Therefore,
sum of 0th power is 1^0+1^0+1^0 + 1^0+2^0+1^0 + 1^0+1^0+3^0 = 9

sum of 1st power is 1^1+1^1+1^1 + 1^1+2^1+1^1 + 1^1+1^1+3^1 = 12

so on ...

Test case2:

the board is as follows:

1(gcd 1)  2(gcd 2)  3(gcd 3)  4(gcd 4)  5(gcd 5)

Therefore,

sum of 0th power is 1^0+2^0+3^0+4^0+5^0 = 5

sum of 1st power is 1^1+2^1+3^1+4^1+5^1 = 15

so on ...
