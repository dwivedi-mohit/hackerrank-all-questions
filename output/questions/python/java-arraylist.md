## Problem Statement

Sometimes it's better to use dynamic size arrays. Java's  [Arraylist](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html) can provide you this feature. Try to solve this problem using Arraylist.<br>

You are given $n$ lines. In each line there are zero or more integers. You need to answer a few queries where you need to tell the number located in $y^{th}$ position of $x^{th}$ line. <br>

Take your input from System.in.

**Input Format**<br>
The first line has an integer $n$. In each of the next $n$ lines there will be an integer $d$ denoting number of integers on that line and then there will be $d$ space-separated integers. In the next line there will be an integer $q$ denoting number of queries. Each query will consist of two integers $x$ and $y$.

**Constraints**<br>

* $1<=n<=20000$
* $0<=d<=50000$
* $1<=q<=1000$
* $1<=x<=n$

Each number will fit in signed integer.<br>
Total number of integers in $n$ lines will not cross $10^5$.<br>

**Output Format**<br>
In each line, output the number  located in $y^{th}$ position of $x^{th}$ line. If there is no such position, just print "ERROR!"



## Input Format

The first line has an integer . In each of the next  lines there will be an integer  denoting number of integers on that line and then there will be  space-separated integers. In the next line there will be an integer  denoting number of queries. Each query will consist of two integers  and .
