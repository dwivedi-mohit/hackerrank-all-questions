## Problem Statement

You are given an *MxN* grid and a 6 sided dice starting at the point (1, 1). You can only move dice toward right or down by rotating it in the respective direction. The value of the dice is the number of pips on the top face of it.

![Initial Grid](http://hr-challenge-images.s3.amazonaws.com/2508/Initial_Grid.png)

If at _i<sup>th</sup>_ step dice is rotated to right, then new configuration will be

1. *Top[i]* = *Left[i-1]*
2. *Bottom[i]* = *Right[i-1]*
3. *Left[i]* = *Bottom[i-1]*
4. *Right[i]* = *Top[i-1]*
5. *Front[i]* = *Front[i-1]*
6. *Back[i]* = *Back[i-1]*

Similarly, if at _i<sup>th</sup>_ step dice is rotated down, then new configuration will be

1. *Top[i]* = *Back[i-1]*
2. *Bottom[i]* = *Front[i-1]*
3. *Left[i]* = *Left[i-1]*
4. *Right[i]* = *Right[i-1]*
5. *Front[i]* = *Top[i-1]*
6. *Back[i]* = *Bottom[i-1]*

Initially dice is at point (1, 1), and its top face has 1 pip, front face has 2 pips, and left face has 3 pips.    
A path sum to a point is the sum of value of dice when it is rolled to that point from (1, 1). As already stated, value at the current location is the number of pips on the top face of the dice. Find the maximum path sum to (*M*, *N*).


**Note**  
The sum of pips at each pair of opposing sides is always 7.  

**Input**  
The first line contains an integer, _T_, which denotes the number of test cases. _T_ lines follow.  
Each of these lines contains two space separated integers, _M N_, which represent the final point in the grid.


**Output**  
For each test case, print the sum of maximal path to (*M*, *N*).  

**Constraints**

**Explanation**  
*Case #00:* There are two ways to reach (2, 2). Both's sum will be 9.

    Position :    (1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (2, 2)
    Direction:          Right     Down
    Value    :      1    +    3    +    5     =    9

*Case #01:* Dice has to roll toward right only one time.

    Position :    (1, 1) -> (1, 2)
    Direction:          Right
    Value    :      1    +    3      =    4


*Case #02:* Dice has to roll down only one time.

    Position :    (1, 1) -> (2, 1)
    Direction:          Down
    Value    :      1    +    5      =    6

*Case #03:* There are six ways in which dice can be rotated to (3, 3)

	Position :    (1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 3) -> (2, 3) -> (3, 3)
    Direction:          Right     Right     Down      Down
    Value    :      1    +    3    +     6   +    5    +    1    = 16
    
	Position :    (1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (2, 2) -> (2, 3) -> (3, 3)
    Direction:          Right     Down      Right     Down
    Value    :      1    +    3    +     5   +    6    +    4    = 19
        
	Position :    (1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (2, 2) -> (3, 2) -> (3, 4)
    Direction:          Right     Down      Down      Right
    Value    :      1    +    3    +     5   +    4    +    6    = 19
    
	Position :    (1, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (2, 2) -> (2, 3) -> (3, 3)
    Direction:          Down      Right     Right     Down
    Value    :      1    +    5    +     3   +    2    +    6    = 17
    
	Position :    (1, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (2, 2) -> (3, 2) -> (3, 3)
    Direction:          Down      Right     Down      Right
    Value    :      1    +    5    +     3   +    6    +    2    = 17

	Position :    (1, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (3, 1) -> (3, 2) -> (3, 3)
    Direction:          Down      Down      Right     Right
    Value    :      1    +    5    +     6   +    3    +    1    = 16

So (Right, Down, Right, Down) or (Right, Down, Down, Right) will be best rotations for this case.
