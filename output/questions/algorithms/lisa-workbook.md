## Preview

A workbook with chapters. Some number of problems per page. How many problems have a number equal to a page's number?

## Problem Statement

Lisa just got a new math workbook.  A workbook contains exercise problems, grouped into chapters.  Lisa believes a problem to be *special* if its index (within a chapter) is the same as the page number where it's located.  The format of Lisa's book is as follows:

* There are $n$ chapters in Lisa's workbook, numbered from $1$ to $n$.
* The $i^{th}$ chapter has $arr[i]$ problems, numbered from $1$ to $arr[i]$.
* Each page can hold *up to* $k$ problems. Only a chapter's last page of exercises may contain fewer than $k$ problems.
* Each new chapter starts on a new page, so a page *will never* contain problems from more than one chapter.
* The page number indexing starts at $1$.

Given the details for Lisa's workbook, can you count its number of *special* problems?
 
**Example**  

$arr = [4, 2]$ 

$k = 3$ 


Lisa's workbook contains $arr[1] = 4$ problems for chapter $1$, and $arr[2] = 2$ problems for chapter $2$.  Each page can hold $k=3$ problems.


The first page will hold $3$ problems for chapter $1$.  Problem $1$ is on page $1$, so it is *special*.  Page $2$ contains only Chapter $1$, Problem $4$, so no *special* problem is on page $2$.  Chapter $2$ problems start on page $3$ and there are $2$ problems.  Since there is no problem $3$ on page $3$, there is no *special* problem on that page either.  There is $1$ *special* problem in her workbook.

**Note:** See the diagram in the *Explanation* section for more details.


**Function Description**


Complete the *workbook* function in the editor below.   


workbook has the following parameter(s):


- *int n:* the number of chapters     

- *int k:* the maximum number of problems per page

- *int arr[n]:* the number of problems in each chapter


**Returns** 

- *int:* the number of special problems in the workbook

## Input Format

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$, the number of chapters and the maximum number of problems per page.

The second line contains $n$ space-separated integers $arr[i]$ where $arr[i]$ denotes the number of problems in the $i^{th}$ chapter.

## Constraints

- $1 \le n, k, arr[i] \le 100$
