Define a 3-D Matrix in which each block contains 0 initially. The first block is defined by the coordinates (1,1,1) and the last block is defined by the coordinates (n,n,n). There are two types of queries.

    UPDATE x y z W

Update the value of block (x,y,z) to W.

    QUERY x1 y1 z1 x2 y2 z2

Calculate the sum of the values of blocks whose x coordinate is between x1 and x2 (inclusive), y coordinate between y1 and y2 (inclusive) and z coordinate between z1 and z2 (inclusive). 

**Function Description**  

Complete the *cubeSum* function in the editor below.  

*cubeSum* has the following parameters:
- *int n: the dimensions of the 3-d matrix
- *string operations[m]:* the operations to perform  

**Returns**   
- *int[]:* the results of each `QUERY` operation  

**Input Format**  
The first line contains an integer $T$, the number of test-cases. $T$ testcases follow.  

For each test case, the first line contains two space-separated integers, $n$ and $m$. 
	$n$ defines the $n\times n\times n$ matrix.  
$m$ defines the number of operations.  
The next $m$ lines will contain an operation either of these forms:  

     1. UPDATE x y z W
     2. QUERY  x1 y1 z1 x2 y2 z2 



**Constraints**    
$1 \le T \le 50$  
$1 \le n \le 100$  
$1 \le m \le 1000$  
$1 \le x1 \le x2 \le n$  
$1 \le y1 \le y2 \le n$  
$1 \le z1 \le z2 \le n$  
$1 \le x,y,z \le n$  
-10<sup>9</sup> \le W \le 10<sup>9</sup>

    UPDATE 2 2 2 4
    QUERY 1 1 1 3 3 3
    UPDATE 1 1 1 23

    QUERY 1 1 1 3 3 3
    2 4
    UPDATE 2 2 2 1
    QUERY 1 1 1 1 1 1
    QUERY 1 1 1 2 2 2
    QUERY 2 2 2 2 2 2

**Sample Output**

**Explanation**  
In the first test case, there is a cube of 4 * 4 * 4 and there are 5 queries.  Initially all the cells (1,1,1) to (4,4,4) are 0.  
`UPDATE 2 2 2 4` makes the cell (2,2,2) = 4  
`QUERY 1 1 1 3 3 3`. As (2,2,2) is updated to 4 and the rest are all 0. The answer to this query is 4.  
`UPDATE 1 1 1 23`. updates the cell (1,1,1) to 23. 
`QUERY 2 2 2 4 4 4`. Only the cell (1,1,1) and (2,2,2) are non-zero and (1,1,1) is not between (2,2,2) and (4,4,4). So, the answer is 4.   
`QUERY 1 1 1 3 3 3`. 2 cells are non-zero and their sum is 23+4 = 27.

## Explanation

In the first test case, there is a cube of 4 * 4 * 4 and there are 5 queries.  Initially all the cells (1,1,1) to (4,4,4) are 0.

UPDATE 2 2 2 4 makes the cell (2,2,2) = 4

QUERY 1 1 1 3 3 3. As (2,2,2) is updated to 4 and the rest are all 0. The answer to this query is 4.

UPDATE 1 1 1 23. updates the cell (1,1,1) to 23.
QUERY 2 2 2 4 4 4. Only the cell (1,1,1) and (2,2,2) are non-zero and (1,1,1) is not between (2,2,2) and (4,4,4). So, the answer is 4.

QUERY 1 1 1 3 3 3. 2 cells are non-zero and their sum is 23+4 = 27.
