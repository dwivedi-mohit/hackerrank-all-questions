## Problem Statement

A numeric string, $s$, is *beautiful* if it can be split into a sequence of two or more positive integers, $a[1],a[2], \ldots ,a[n]$, satisfying the following conditions:

1. $a[i]-a[i-1]=1$ for any $1 < i \le n$ (i.e., each element in the sequence is $1$ more than the previous element).
2. *No $a[i]$ contains a leading zero.* For example, we can split $s = 10203$ into the sequence $\{1, 02, 03\}$, but it is *not* beautiful because $02$ and $03$ have leading zeroes.
3. *The contents of the sequence cannot be rearranged.* For example, we can split $s = 312$ into the sequence $\{3, 1, 2\}$, but it is not beautiful because it breaks our first constraint (i.e., $1 - 3 \ne 1$).

The diagram below depicts some beautiful strings:

Perform $q$ queries where each query consists of some integer string $s$. For each query, print whether or not the string is beautiful on a new line. If it is beautiful, print ``YES x``, where $x$ is the first number of the increasing sequence.  If there are multiple such values of $x$, choose the smallest.  Otherwise, print `NO`.  

**Function Description**  

Complete the *separateNumbers* function in the editor below.  

separateNumbers has the following parameter:  

- *s*: an integer value represented as a string   

**Prints**   
- *string:*  Print a string as described above. Return nothing.  

## Input Format

The first line contains an integer $q$, the number of strings to evaluate. 	
Each of the next $q$ lines contains an integer string $s$ to query.

## Output Format

  

## Constraints

* $1 \le q \le 10$
* $1 \le |s| \le 32$
* $s[i] \in [0-9]$
