## Problem Statement

Given an undirected weighted connected graph, find the Really Special SubTree in it. The Really Special SubTree is defined as a subgraph consisting of all the nodes in the graph and: 

* There is only one exclusive path from a node to every other node. 
* The subgraph is of minimum overall weight (sum of all edges) among all such subgraphs.  
* No cycles are formed

To create the Really Special SubTree, always pick the edge with smallest weight. Determine if including it will create a cycle.  If so, ignore the edge.  If there are edges of equal weight available:

- Choose the edge that minimizes the sum $u+v+wt$ where $u$ and $v$ are vertices and $wt$ is the edge weight.
- If there is still a collision, choose any of them.
    
Print the overall weight of the tree formed using the rules.

For example, given the following edges:
```
u	v	wt
1	2	2
2	3	3
3	1	5
```
First choose $1\rightarrow 2$ at weight $2$.  Next choose $2\rightarrow 3$ at weight $3$.  All nodes are connected without cycles for a total weight of $3+2=5$.  

**Function Description**  

Complete the $kruskals$ function in the editor below.  It should return an integer that represents the total weight of the subtree formed.  

kruskals has the following parameters:  

- *g_nodes*: an integer that represents the number of nodes in the tree  
- *g_from*: an array of integers that represent beginning edge node numbers  
- *g_to*: an array of integers that represent ending edge node numbers  
- *g_weight*: an array of integers that represent the weights of each edge  

## Input Format

The first line has two space-separated integers $g\_nodes$ and $g\_edges$, the number of nodes and edges in the graph.  

The next $g\_edges$ lines each consist of three space-separated integers $g\_from$, $g\_to$ and $g\_weight$, where $g\_from$ and $g\_to$ denote the two nodes between which the __undirected__ edge exists and $g\_weight$ denotes the weight of that edge.  

## Output Format

Print a single integer denoting the total weight of the Really Special SubTree.

## Constraints

+ $2 \le g\_nodes \le 3000$  
+ $1 \le g\_edges \le \frac{N*(N-1)}{2}$  
+ $1 \le g\_from, g\_to \le N$  
+ $0 \le g\_weight \le 10^5$   

**Note: ** If there are edges between the same pair of nodes with different weights, they are to be considered as is, like multiple edges.
