## Problem Statement




There are N cities and N directed roads in Steven's world. The cities are numbered from 0 to N - 1. Steven can travel from city *i* to city *(i + 1) % N*, ( 0-> 1 -> 2 -> .... -> N - 1 -> 0). 

Steven wants to travel around the world by car. The capacity of his car's fuel tank is C gallons. There are a[i] gallons he can use at the beginning of city *i* and the car takes b[i] gallons to travel from city *i* to *(i + 1) % N*.  
 
How many cities can Steven start his car from so that he can travel around the world and reach the same city he started? 

**Note**  

The fuel tank is initially empty. 


## Input Format

The first line contains two integers (separated by a space): city number *N* and capacity *C*.  
The second line contains *N* space-separated integers: a[0], a[1], … , a[N - 1].  
The third line contains *N* space-separated integers: b[0], b[1], … , b[N - 1].  


## Output Format

The number of cities which can be chosen as the start city.


## Constraints

2 &le; N &le; 10<sup>5</sup>    
1 &le; C &le; 10<sup>18</sup>  
0 &le; a[i], b[i] &le; 10<sup>9</sup>  


## Sample Input

3 3
3 1 2
2 2 2

## Explanation

Steven starts from city 0, fills his car with 3 gallons of fuel, and use 2 gallons of fuel to travel to city 1. His fuel tank now has 1 gallon of fuel.

On refueling 1 gallon of fuel at city 1, he then travels to city 2 by using 2 gallons of fuel. His fuel tank is now empty.

On refueling 2 gallon of fuel at city 2, he then travels back to city 0 by using 2 gallons of fuel.

Here is the second possible solution.

Steven starts from city 2, fill his car with 2 gallons, and travels to city 0.

On refueling 3 gallons of fuel from city 0, he then travels to city 1, and exhausts 2 gallons of fuel. His fuel tank contains 1 gallon of fuel now.
He can then refuel 1 gallon of fuel at City 1, and increase his car's fuel to 2 gallons and travel to city 2.

However, Steven cannot start from city 1, because he is given only 1 gallon of fuel, but travelling to city 2 requires 2 gallons.

Hence the answer 2.
