## Problem Statement



You are using at most **A** number of 1s and at most **B** number of 2s. How many different evaluation results are possible when they are formed in an expression containing only addition `+` sign and multiplication `*` sign are allowed?

Note that, multiplication takes precedence over addition.

For example, if **A=2** and **B=2**, then we have the following expressions:

*  `1`, `1*1` = 1
*  `2`, `1*2`, `1*1*2`, `1+1` = 2
*  `1+2`, `1+1*2` = 3
*  `2+2`, `2*2`, `1+1+2`, `1*2*2`, `1*1*2*2`, `1*2+1*2`, `1*1*2+2`, `1*2+2` = 4
*  `1+2+2`, `1+1*2+2` = 5
*  `1+1+2+2`,  `1+1+2*2` = 6

So there are 6 unique results that can be formed if A = 2 and B = 2. 


## Input Format

The first line contains the number of test cases T, T testcases follow each in a newline.  
Each testcase contains 2 integers A and B separated by a single space.  


## Output Format

Print the number of different evaluations modulo (%) (10<sup>9</sup>+7.)


## Constraints

1 <= T <= 10<sup>5</sup>  
0<=A<=1000000000  
0<=B<=1000  


## Sample Input

0 0
2 2
0 2
2 0

## Sample Output

6
2
2

## Explanation

- When A = 0, B = 0, there are no expressions, hence 0.

- When A = 2, B = 2, as explained in the problem statement above, expressions leads to 6 possible solutions.

- When A = 0, B = 2, we have 2, 2+2 or 2*2, hence 2.

- When A = 2, B = 0, we have 1 or 1*1, 1+1 hence 2.
