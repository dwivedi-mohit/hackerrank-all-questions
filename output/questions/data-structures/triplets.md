How many distinct ascending triples are there in the given array?

## Problem Statement

There is an integer array $d$ which does not contain more than two elements of the same value. How many distinct ascending triples ($d[i] \lt d[j] \lt d[k], i \lt j \lt k$) are present? 

**Input format**

The first line contains an integer, $N$, denoting the number of elements in the array. This is followed by a single line, containing $N$ space-separated integers. Please note that there are no leading spaces before the first number, and there are no trailing spaces after the last number.

**Output format:**

A single integer that denotes the number of distinct ascending triplets present in the array.

**Constraints:**

$N \le 10$<sup>$5$</sup>

Every element of the array is present at most twice.

Every element of the array is a 32-bit non-negative integer.

**Sample input:**


    6

    1 1 2 2 3 4

  

**Sample output:**


    4

**Explanation**

The distinct triplets are

(1,2,3)

(1,2,4)

(1,3,4)

(2,3,4)

The elements of the array might not be sorted. Make no assumptions of the same.
