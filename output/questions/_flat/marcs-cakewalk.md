## Preview

Find the minimum number of miles Marc must walk to burn the calories consumed from eating cupcakes.

## Problem Statement

Marc loves cupcakes, but he also likes to stay fit. Each cupcake has a calorie count, and Marc can walk a distance to expend those calories.  If Marc has eaten $j$ cupcakes so far, after eating a cupcake with $c$ calories he must walk *at least* $2^j \times c$  miles to maintain his weight.

**Example**  

$calorie = [5, 10, 7]$ 


If he eats the cupcakes in the order shown, the miles he will need to walk are $(2^0\times 5) + (2^1\times 10) + (2^2\times 7) = 5 + 20 + 28 = 53$.  This is not the minimum, though, so we need to test other orders of consumption.  In this case, our minimum miles is calculated as $(2^0\times 10) + (2^1\times 7) + (2^2 \times 5) = 10 + 14 + 20 = 44$.

Given the individual calorie counts for each of the cupcakes, determine the minimum number of miles Marc must walk to maintain his weight. Note that he can eat the cupcakes *in any order*.


**Function Description**


Complete the *marcsCakewalk* function in the editor below.


marcsCakewalk has the following parameter(s):
