A Game of Stones

## Problem Statement

Two players called $P1$ and $P2$ are playing a game with a starting number of stones. Player $1$ always plays first, and the two players move in alternating turns. The game's rules are as follows:

- In a single move, a player can remove either $2$, $3$, or $5$ stones from the game board. 
- If a player is unable to make a move, that player loses the game.

Given the starting number of stones, find and print the name of the winner.  $P1$ is named `First` and $P2$ is named `Second`.  Each player plays optimally, meaning they will not make a move that causes them to lose the game if a winning move exists.

For example, if $n=4$, $P1$ can make the following moves:


- $P1$ removes $2$ stones leaving $2$. $P2$ will then remove $2$ stones and win.
- $P1$ removes $3$ stones leaving $1$. $P2$ cannot move and loses.

$P1$ would make the second play and win the game.
