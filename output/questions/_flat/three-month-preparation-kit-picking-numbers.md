## Preview

What's the largest size subset can you choose from an array such that the difference between any two integers is not bigger than 1?

## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers, find the longest subset where the absolute difference between any two elements is less than or equal to $1$.


**Example**


$a=[1,1,2,2,4,4,5,5,5]$


There are two subset meeting the criterion: $[1,1,2,2]$ and $[4,4,5,5,5]$.  The maximum length subset has $5$ elements.

**Function Description**


Complete the *pickingNumbers* function in the editor below.


pickingNumbers has the following parameter(s):


- *int a[n]:* an array of integers


**Returns**


- *int:*  the length of the longest subset that meets the criterion

## Input Format

The first line contains a single integer $n$, the size of the array $a$.   	
The second line contains $n$ space-separated integers, each an $a[i]$.

## Constraints

- $2 \le n \le 100$
- $0 < a[i] < 100$
- The answer will be $\ge 2$.
